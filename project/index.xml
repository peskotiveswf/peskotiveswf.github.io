      <description>Inspired by the way humans utilize semantic knowledge between objects of interests, we propose a novel deep learning framework that incorporates knowledge graphs for describing the relationships between multiple labels to achieve multi-label zero-shot learning (ML-ZSL).</description>

      <title>Sketch-based Image Retrieval across Art Styles</title>
      <link>https://people.csail.mit.edu/weifang/project/mmai17-retrieval/</link>

      <guid>https://people.csail.mit.edu/weifang/project/mmai17-retrieval/</guid>
      <description>In this project, we try to perform cross-domain image retrieval across different art styles using sketches as queries. Given a sketch image and a target art domain, we aim to retrieve images that are semantically similar in that particular art domain.
We surveyed a few papers and a dataset by Adobe and Cornell Tech in the proceedings of this yearâ€™s ICCV conference (ICCV 2017). The Behance Artistic Media (BAM) dataset consists of images of 9 kinds of objects for 7 different art styles such as oil paint or vector art.</description>
